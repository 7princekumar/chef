                                INTRODUCTION


Restaurant managers are pulled in so many different directions – front of the house, 
back of the house, customer needs, staff needs, inventory, P&Ls, food quality, 
service quality, etc… The list goes on and on. In any given day’s work, the tasks
and responsibilities expected of a restaurant manager can be overwhelming.


All of these pressures and obligations can lead to decreased productivity and
eventually burnout, making time management an essential tool. This program 
is  one of the strategy which can help restaurant managers balance their time 
by efficiently assigning jobs to all the chefs present in his restaurant.


In this, each customer (there can be ’n’ customers) orders any number of food 
items and the program decides which food item should be handled by which chef
(numbers of chefs for a restaurant is fixed) so that whole order of each 
customer reaches their table taking as minimum time as possible. Also, customers
are given priority on the basis of who orders first.
